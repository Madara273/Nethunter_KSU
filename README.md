## 📌 About this repo

This repository is a **modified version of the original NetHunter Magisk module**, adapted for **KernelSU (KSU)**.
What was changed? — **nothing, I just added an install.sh script that helps install the NetHunter module via the KSU manager.**
The project is based on the idea from [poxiao676/Nethunter_KSU_Module](https://github.com/poxiao676/Nethunter_KSU_Module), but:

- ❌ The original module has not been updated for a long time
- ✅ It was decided to simplify, clean up, and adapt it to current realities. Fixed rootfs installation and boot animation
for custom A14 and A15 ROMs based on LineageOS

---

## 🚀 Features
